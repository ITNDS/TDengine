  // subsequent probe succeeds.

  // entry by entry in decreasing order, will be the product of the
  // length of the diverging tails and the network round-trip latency,

    // If the follower has an uncommitted log tail, we would end up
    // probing one by one until we hit the common prefix.
    //
    // For example, if the leader has:
    //
    //   idx        1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
    //              -----------------
    //   term (L)   1 3 3 3 5 5 5 5 5
    //   term (F)   1 1 1 1 2 2
    //
    // Then, after sending an append anchored at (idx=9,term=5) we
    // would receive a RejectHint of 6 and LogTerm of 2. Without the
    // code below, we would try an append at index 6, which would
    // fail again.
    //
    // However, looking only at what the leader knows about its own
    // log and the rejection hint, it is clear that a probe at index
    // 6, 5, 4, 3, and 2 must fail as well:
    //
    // For all of these indexes, the leader's log term is larger than
    // the rejection's log term. If a probe at one of these indexes
    // succeeded, its log term at that index would match the leader's,
    // i.e. 3 or 5 in this example. But the follower already told the
    // leader that it is still at term 2 at index 9, and since the
    // log term only ever goes up (within a log), this is a contradiction.
    //
    // At index 1, however, the leader can draw no such conclusion,
    // as its term 1 is not larger than the term 2 from the
    // follower's rejection. We thus probe at 1, which will succeed
    // in this example. In general, with this approach we probe at
    // most once per term found in the leader's log.
    //
    // There is a similar mechanism on the follower (implemented in
    // handleAppendEntries via a call to findConflictByTerm) that is
    // useful if the follower has a large divergent uncommitted log
    // tail[1], as in this example:
    //
    //   idx        1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
    //              -----------------
    //   term (L)   1 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 7
    //   term (F)   1 3 3 4 4 5 5 5 6
    //
    // Naively, the leader would probe at idx=9, receive a rejection
    // revealing the log term of 6 at the follower. Since the leader's
    // term at the previous index is already smaller than 6, the leader-
    // side optimization discussed above is ineffective. The leader thus
    // probes at index 8 and, naively, receives a rejection for the same
    // index and log term 5. Again, the leader optimization does not improve
    // over linear probing as term 5 is above the leader's term 3 for that
    // and many preceding indexes; the leader would have to probe linearly
    // until it would finally hit index 3, where the probe would succeed.
    //
    // Instead, we apply a similar optimization on the follower. When the
    // follower receives the probe at index 8 (log term 3), it concludes
    // that all of the leader's log preceding that index has log terms of
    // 3 or below. The largest index in the follower's log with a log term
    // of 3 or below is index 3. The follower will thus return a rejection
    // for index=3, log term=3 instead. The leader's next probe will then
    // succeed at that index.
    //
    // [1]: more precisely, if the log terms in the large uncommitted
    // tail on the follower are larger than the leader's. At first,
    // it may seem unintuitive that a follower could even have such
    // a large tail, but it can happen:
    //
    // 1. Leader appends (but does not commit) entries 2 and 3, crashes.
    //   idx        1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
    //              -----------------
    //   term (L)   1 2 2     [crashes]
    //   term (F)   1
    //   term (F)   1
    //
    // 2. a follower becomes leader and appends entries at term 3.
    //              -----------------
    //   term (x)   1 2 2     [down]
    //   term (F)   1 3 3 3 3
    //   term (F)   1
    //
    // 3. term 3 leader goes down, term 2 leader returns as term 4
    //    leader. It commits the log & entries at term 4.
    //
    //              -----------------
    //   term (L)   1 2 2 2
